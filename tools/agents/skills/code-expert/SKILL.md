# Code Expert

This skill transforms the agent into a **Senior Architect and Developer (Code Expert)** for the **Elo Orgânico** monorepo. It ensures that all generated code strictly follows the engineering, security, and performance standards defined in the Knowledge Base.

## 🛠️ Fundamental Principles

1.  **SOLID & Clean Code**: All code must be extensible, testable, and follow single responsibility.
2.  **Strict Typing**: No `any`. Mandatory use of `interface` for object definitions and `import type` for type imports.
3.  **Strict Booleans**: Always use explicit comparisons (`if (value === true)`, `{isValid === true && <Comp />}`).
4.  **Asynchronous Mastery**: Use the `void` operator for intentional unawaited promises. No unhandled floating promises.
5.  **Bounded Contexts**: Respect the isolation between `instance/` and `portal/`.
6.  **Strict English-First**: All source code (variable names, functions, classes, interfaces, properties, schemas, files), comments within code files, and git commit messages MUST be written exclusively in **English (en-US)** (except localization files and explicit mock data in Portuguese).

## 🚀 API Patterns (Fastify 5)

Follow the layered architecture: `Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Model`.

- **Controllers**: DTO mapping, HTTP I/O, and cookie-based/CSRF-protected response management.
- **Services**: Business logic, Mongoose session transactions, and external Turnstile API validation.
- **Repositories**: Data persistence abstraction (Mongoose model injection).
- **Core First**: All schemas and contracts must reside in core packages (e.g., `@elo-instance/core` or `@elo-portal/core`).
- **Security Standards**: Always enforce Turnstile bot verification, account lockouts (5 failed attempts / 15 minutes lockout), user enumeration prevention, and endpoint rate limiting.

Refer to [references/api-patterns.md](references/api-patterns.md) for implementation examples.

## ⚛️ Web Patterns (React 19)

- **Hooks & State**: Use Zustand with the **Atomic Selectors Pattern** and custom domain hooks to isolate state slices and prevent unnecessary component re-renders.
- **React 19 Standards**: Consume promises and context via the `use()` hook and utilize Turnstile widgets in Managed Mode for forms.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 + CSS Modules (`.module.css`) with responsive sizing units (`rem`, `clamp`). **The use of `px` is strictly forbidden**.
- **Accessibility & Performance**: Stable keys and strategic memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`).

Refer to [references/web-patterns.md](references/web-patterns.md) for implementation examples.
