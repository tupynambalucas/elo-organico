The Docs workspace manages the official documentation hub for the Elo Orgânico project, known as **EloDocs**. Built on Docusaurus, it serves as the central developer portal, housing architectural guidelines, style guides, product planning documents, and automated project changelogs and roadmaps.

## Core Architecture and Custom Plugins

EloDocs is configured with a multi-instance documentation setup using Docusaurus plugins to segment the different areas of the developer portal with independent left sidebars:

1.  **General Documentation (Docs)**: Located in `handbook/` and mapped to `/docs`. Governs high-level architectural briefs, security strategies, coding style guides, and master vision files.
2.  **Strategic Roadmaps (Roadmap)**: Located in `roadmap/` and mapped to `/roadmap`. Governs context-specific milestones and goals.
3.  **Workspaces (Workspaces)**: Located in `workspaces/` and mapped to `/workspaces`. Houses detailed modular descriptions of each package context.
4.  **Changelog (Blog)**: Located in `releases/` and mapped to `/changelog`. Governs version history and release notes.

## Internationalization (i18n)

EloDocs fully supports English (`en`) and Portuguese (`pt-BR`) locales. Localized files mirror the structure of English documents:
- **General Docs**: `i18n/pt-BR/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`
- **Roadmap Docs**: `i18n/pt-BR/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs-roadmap/current/`
- **Workspaces Docs**: `i18n/pt-BR/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs-workspaces/current/`
- **Changelog Posts**: `i18n/pt-BR/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/`

## Automated Root Compilers

To maintain clean repository standards, EloDocs integrates with build-time script compiles to write unified markdown documentation at the repository root level on deployment:
- **`generate-roadmap.ts`**: Aggregates all context files inside `roadmap/` and generates `/ROADMAP.md` at the repository root.
- **`generate-changelog.ts`**: Parses the release blog posts under `releases/` and generates `/CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Both compiler scripts run inside the `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yaml` workflow to ensure root-level files stay 100% in sync with the developer portal.

## Workspace Scripts

Run these commands from the root directory to manage the EloDocs context:

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm docs:dev` | Launches the local Docusaurus development server at `http://localhost:3002`. |
| `pnpm docs:build` | Compiles the production build of the Docusaurus portal (runs link check validations). |
| `pnpm docs:roadmap` | Manually triggers compiling the modular roadmap documents into the root `ROADMAP.md`. |
| `pnpm docs:changelog` | Manually triggers compiling the release updates into the root `CHANGELOG.md`. |
