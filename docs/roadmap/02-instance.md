This section details the development roadmap for local community shop modules, including Pix payments and Feirinha physical sales events.

## Completed Milestones

### Layered Backend Engine
- **Strict Layered Fastify API**: Built `@elo-instance/api` utilizing Fastify v5 and structured as a strict `Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Model` architecture.
- **Zod Domain Validation & Core Integration**: Integrated `@elo-instance/core` to validate incoming requests using Zod schemas, securing authentication and product catalog payloads.
- **Completed Core Modules**:
  - `auth`: Built routes, JWT generation, and user repositories.
  - `product`: Set up catalog categories, measures, availability flag toggles, and bulk upsert database handlers.
  - `cycle`: Modeled agricultural cycles, order capping limits, and allocation logics.

### Database & Seeding Infrastructure
- **MongoDB Replica Set Dev Configuration**: Configured a containerized MongoDB service in `compose.dev.yaml` executing a Replica Set (`rs0`) with Keyfile-based authentication and a single-responsibility initialization container (`db-init-dev`).
- **Dev Database Seeding Plugin**: Implemented a Fastify startup seeding plugin (`SeedPlugin`) in the API to automatically populate admin credentials and database structure.

### Client-Side Application
- **Vite React 19 Client Web App**: Developed `@elo-instance/web` leveraging React 19, CSS Modules for scoped layout styling, and integrated frontend domains (Auth, Landing pages, Shop views, and Admin control).

## Planned Focus
- **Feirinha (Farmer's Market) Module**: Expand features to support physical, real-time local sales events.
- **Data Isolation**: Configure dedicated local database collections and models.
- **Pay-as-you-go Pix Integration**: Integrate immediate Pix instant payment checkout flows in the backend API.
- **Instance Administrative Panels**: Develop event creation and dashboard reconciliation modules on the frontend.
